      <p>While it seems that everyone you meet now adays uses technology actively, the Digital Divide in Canada is still quite present. Those who 
        do not have the access, education, or income to participate are being left out of a important part of society. There are several groups in Canada
        that do not receive sufficient access, and decreasing the digital divide starts with addressing those who are disadvantaged

                 its no wonder that technology is inadequately distributed to the lower class. Increasing digital literacy among the lower class enables workers 
                 to find more variety of work in a workforce that is constantly adapting to technological changes. With the staggerying wealth inequality in North
                 America, equal literacy among all classes enables fair competition and social and economic movement.

                <p>
                The Canadian Broadband Fund is a program launched by the Canadian government in 2019 to invest $1.75 billion over five years to support
                  the expansion of broadband internet services in underserved areas of the country. The program aims to improve access to reliable 
                  high-speed internet for Canadians in rural and remote communities, as well as Indigenous peoples.
                  It provides funding to internet service providers and other organizations to build or upgrade broadband infrastructure
                  in areas that are currently underserved.

                <h3>Connecting Families Initiative</h3>
                The Connecting Families Initiative is a program that aims to provide low-income families with access to low-cost 
                internet services and affordable computers. The program is specifically targeted at families with children who need internet 
                access for educational purposes. By providing low-cost access to the internet and computers, the program helps to ensure that all children have 
                the tools they need to fully participate in the digital economy.

                <h3>Indigenous Connectivity Summit</h3>
                The Indigenous Connectivity Summit is an annual conference in Canada that brings together Indigenous leaders, government officials,
                 and industry representatives to discuss strategies for improving connectivity in Indigenous communities. The summit aims to 
                 identify barriers to connectivity and develop solutions to address these challenges. Some of the topics covered at the summit
